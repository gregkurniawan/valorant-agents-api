# Simple Valorant API

This is just a simple valorant API created to practice server side code and to practice pushing code to Cyclic.sh.

If you are cloning the code, be sure to:
1. npm init
2. npm install express --save

To view the data in JSON format use the link below and add api/agent-name.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, Express, Node.js

I used node.js and installed express. Then, I added the Agents objects for the user output. Simply used .get to send the file in JSON format and .listen for the port.


## Lessons Learned:

Practicing with node.js and express was very thrilling because it made me realize pretty much any API I thought of could be built and shared with, essentially, the rest of the world.
